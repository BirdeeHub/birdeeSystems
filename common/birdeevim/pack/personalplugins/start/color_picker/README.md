[This was based on this repo, idk if its changed since then but at one point some of the things in here came from some parts of there.](https://github.com/OXY2DEV/colors.nvim/tree/main/lua/colors)

I wanted to turn just the picker part of that into a whole plugin but then I found other plugins kinda like it and lost some motivation.

Will probably return to this eventually.

I did some refactoring to separate out the gradient part into a thing that can be fed arbitrary single pickers and make a gradient out of them.

So that cut down on a lot of code that would have been associated with making gradient views with other types of color spaces.

IDK maybe I finish it to my standards eventually, regardless it still works and I use it sometimes.
