I am not particularly convinced most of these lua builder things are any good.

The embed thing is kinda interesting?
If you have C that you call from your lua and then you want to call some lua inside it to make it easier to write, you can precompile and embed lua with it.

The main thing these things in this directory have in common is that they
were fun to write and interesting enough not to delete.

The backup rotator thing is an interesting recursive bash idea.

I am not sure when or if I will use any of these.
