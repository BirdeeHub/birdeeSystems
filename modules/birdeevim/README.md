# A Lua-natic's neovim flake: birdeeVim

This is my configuration. 

It has ai and other random stuff, 

so if you are using the kickstarter version, you can see a few more examples here.

This config literally just imports the builder from that one and then does its own thing with it.

So yeah, honestly this is probably the coolest way to use nixCats.

for the kickstarter version that this one imports from, 

see this thing I made called [nixCats-nvim](https://github.com/BirdeeHub/nixCats-nvim)

## Attention!! THIS IS MY REGULAR CONFIG FILE
## I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO BREAK IT AT ANY TIME.
