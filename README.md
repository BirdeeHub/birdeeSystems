Just me learning how to use nix. I actually started making nixCats before using nixOS.

TODO:

get nvidia card working on macbook pro 9,1 (2012 macbook 3rd gen i7 and intel+nvidia gt 650M mac edition gpus)

make auto monitor adjustment script fired from udev not glitch out with multiple users

set up tmux

figure out secret management

set up disko and nixos-anywhere or other provisioning solutions that I may find out about

set up secure rdp config for desktop from remote machines

move as much as I can from i3 system module to a home-manager module

---

Currently have asus rog fx504gd set up

Mac 9,1 works but no nvidia card yet.

good nvim setup, but I want to make a notes profile for it since I have this whole "as many different nvim configs as you want" thing with [nixCats-nvim](https://github.com/BirdeeHub/nixCats-nvim/tree/nixCats-5.0.0)

so also, TODO: notes specific nvim setup
